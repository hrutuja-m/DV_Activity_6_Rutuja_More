# In-Class Activity: Manipulable View

**Visualization Features:**

* Data Modification
* Channel Modification
* Derived Feature Modification (contours)


## Instructions:

1. **Review the Provided Code:** Read through the code carefully to understand how it works.
2. **Identify Missing Parts:** Look for sections of the code related to color scale and contour generation that need to be completed.
3. **Implement the Color Scale:** Use the `d3.scaleLinear()` function to create a color scale. Set the `domain` and `range` to map data values to colors. 40 points
4. **Complete the Contour Generation:** Finish the `d3.contours()` function by setting the correct `bin count` and `thresholds (min and max)`. 40 points
5. **Make a web page on GitHub Pages for this activity** 20 points

The outcome should look like the screenshot
